# Step-by-Step Workflow Documentation

This documentation outlines the commands executed by the user, Matthew Feroz, while working on the Plumbing Website project. Each step includes an explanation of the command, its context, and any important details.

## Step 1: Navigate to the Project Directory

**Command:**
```bash
C:\Users\Matthew Feroz\Desktop\Plumbing Website\plumbing-website>
```

### Explanation:
In this step, the user is navigating to the project directory where the Plumbing Website files are located. This is essential because all subsequent commands will be executed within this directory.

### Context:
Before performing any operations related to the project, it's crucial to ensure that you are in the correct directory. This prevents errors that may occur if commands are run in the wrong location.

### Important Details:
- Ensure that the path is correct and that the directory exists.
- You can use the `cd` command to change directories if needed.

## Step 2: Execute a Command (Placeholder)

```bash
C:\Users\Matthew Feroz\Desktop\Plumbing Website\plumbing-website>
```

### Explanation:
This step appears to be a placeholder for executing a command. The specific command is not provided, but it indicates that the user is still within the project directory.

### Context:
Executing commands in the project directory is necessary for performing tasks such as building the website, running scripts, or managing dependencies.

### Important Details:
- Make sure to replace this placeholder with the actual command you intend to run.
- Common commands in a web development context might include `npm install`, `git pull`, or `python manage.py runserver`.

## Step 3: Update Before Publishing Online

**Command:**
```bash
Update before publishing online
```

### Explanation:
In this step, the user is performing an update to ensure that all files and dependencies are current before publishing the website online. This is a critical step to avoid deploying outdated or broken code.

### Context:
Updating the project can involve pulling the latest changes from a version control system (like Git), installing new dependencies, or running build scripts. This ensures that the live version of the website reflects the latest changes made in the development environment.

### Important Details:
- If using Git, the command might look like `git pull origin main` to fetch the latest changes.
- If using npm, you might run `npm update` to update dependencies.
- Always test the website locally after updates to ensure everything works as expected before going live.

### Conclusion
Following these steps ensures that you are properly navigating your project directory and preparing your website for deployment. Always remember to verify your commands and test your website after updates to maintain a smooth workflow.
